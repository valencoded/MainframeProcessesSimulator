## FCFS (First Come First Served): 
  the process that comes first is scheduled first. It follows the principle of FIFO (First-in-First-Out).
## SJF (Shortest Job First):
  the process with the shortest burst time will begin its execution ahead of others.
## Round Robin:
  each process is cyclically assigned a fixed time slot.
